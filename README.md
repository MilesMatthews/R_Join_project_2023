Data-412 Course project: creating a tutorial on R join functions

You can see an html file with my output and commentary at my [html file for Data-412 Joining Tutorial Project](https://milesmatthews.github.io/R_Join_project_2023/analysis/Joining_Project.html).

I completed this assignment for course Data 412: Statistical Programming in R. The project, including detailed requirements, was assigned by [Professor Rabya Ghafoor](https://www.american.edu/cas/faculty/rg7212a.cfm). I also utilized the lectures given by [Dr. David Gerard](https://www.american.edu/cas/faculty/dgerard.cfm) and the textbook [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garret Grolemund. The objective of the project is to create a tutorial that can help a person learn how to join tables in R, and show an example of how to join two complex tables of real world data. You can see the full tutorial in the html file for my project linked above.
